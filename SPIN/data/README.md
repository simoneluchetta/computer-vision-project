# Extra data
Short description of the additional data files that our code requires to run smoothly. You will get this data by running the ```fetch_data.sh``` script.

### static_fits
The ```static_fits``` folder contains the fits that we use to initialize the SPIN procedure. They are generated by running SMPLify fitting using 2D keypoints from one view or multiple views (MPI-INF-3DHP).

### smpl_mean_params.npz
Mean pose/shape/camera parameters used by the iterative regressor of our networks. This file is a slight modification of the original .h5 file provided by the [HMR repo](https://github.com/akanazawa/hmr).

### J_regressor_extra.npy
Joints regressor for joints or landmarks that are not included in the standard set of SMPL joints.

### J_regressor_h36m.npy
Joints regressor reflecting the Human3.6M joints. Used for evaluation.

### cube_parts.npy & vertex_texture.npy
Files allowing us to do the 6-body part evaluation on LSP. 

### train.h5
Annotations for the training set of the MPII human pose dataset. Recovered from the [Stacked Hourglass repo](https://github.com/princeton-vl/pose-hg-train).
